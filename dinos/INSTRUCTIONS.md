# Instructions

 You will be supplied with two data files in CSV format. The first file contains
 statistics about various dinosaurs. The second file contains additional data.

 Given the following formula,

 > `speed` = ((STRIDE_LENGTH / LEG_LENGTH) - 1) * SQRT(LEG_LENGTH * g)
 
 > Where `g` = 9.8 m/s^2 (gravitational constant)

 Write a program to read in the data files from disk, it must then `print the names`
 of only the `bipedal dinosaurs` from `fastest to slowest`. 
 
 Do not print any other information.
